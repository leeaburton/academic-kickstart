For a while I've wanted to make somewhere that could keep useful info or host unofficial side projects. Thanks to Hugo and github i've been able to put this site together quite easily. For now the plan is to have posts where i can keep snippets i've found useful on certain topics, for example using Blender to create snazzy images, and projects where ideas can be built up bit by bit.

I want to keep redundancy to a minimum, so if you're looking for papers head over to google scholar, random thoughts head over to twitter etc. Here will just be for stand-alone work stuff... apologies in advanced if it's sometimes a little rough around the edges! :)
